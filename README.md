Caruna Plus is a service provided by Caruna, a Finnish electricity distribution company. The service offers customers access to detailed information about their electricity consumption, contracts, and other related data through an online portal and API. The Caruna Plus Client project in your workspace is designed to interact with the Caruna Plus API, allowing users to retrieve and manage their electricity data programmatically.

- **[oma-helen-cli](https://github.com/carohauta/oma-helen-cli)**: An interactive CLI that logs into Oma Helen and offers functions to get contract data or electricity measurement data in JSON format.
